# EvaporChain — Session Progress Tracker

Working journal for the build. Each session appends an entry at the TOP. Newest first.

**This is NOT** `CHANGELOG.md` (formal published ship log) or `AUDIT_*.md` (point-in-time audit). This is the operator-level "what we did + what's next + what's blocked" view across sessions.

---

## How to add an entry (read once, then forget)

When you wrap up a session, prepend a new block at the top using this template. Don't bother with prose — bullet-pointed is fine. The discipline is **consistency of format**, not polish.

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD (morning|afternoon|evening) — short focus

**Focus:** one sentence

**Commits shipped:** N (first-hash → last-hash). See `CHANGELOG.md` for detailed breakdown.

**Deliverables:**
- bullet
- bullet

**Empirical results (if any):**
- what fired in production
- what was observed

**Decisions made:**
- doctrine call X resolved as Y
- parameter Z changed from A to B with reason

**What's next:**
- top 2-3 items for the next session

**Blockers / open questions:**
- anything that needs human judgment / external info / parallel work

**Cross-references:**
- `CHANGELOG.md` <date>
- `AUDIT_*.md` if a new audit doc landed
- `docs/runbooks/*.md` if a new runbook landed
- specific commits worth highlighting

```

The reverse-chronological layout means the most recent session is always at the top. Old entries stay; treat them as historical record. The file grows append-only.

## 2026-05-08 (afternoon) — death-is-final doctrine + Singh Pool API + decay observability

**Focus:** ratchet the chain's namesake decay thesis from "substrate-shipped" to "empirically operational" across all 5 layers; fully wire Singh Pool AMM HTTP surface.

**Commits shipped:** 19 (`24920e6` → `d906d80`). Full detail in `CHANGELOG.md` 2026-05-08 (afternoon).

**Empirical results on the live 5-node WAN cluster:**

```
Decay-thesis layer       Status (post-deploy of 24920e6)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Object Active→Grace→Ghost     fired live (multiple test objects)
HBCT H+1 capacity expiry      fired live (8 positions burned)
Storage-rent → tombstone      fired live (val-1, val-3 organic)
Validator jail-on-tombstone   fired live (R4 ratchet)
Refresh-pool §1.2 absorption  ~155k EVP accrued
Account-balance demurrage     dormant (threshold gating, fixed
                              by 7bdbfaf — fires post-deploy)
```

Cluster reached block 11,000+ during the session under stress (2 jailed validators, 3-of-5 BFT quorum holding).

**Decisions made:**

- **`DemurrageParams::default_genesis()` re-calibrated: threshold 100M → 250k EVP.** Testnet validators sit at 300-600k, far below the original 100M (which was a mainnet-scale calibration assuming 50M+ validator funding). New value: validators above 250k pay ~0.1-1 EVP/epoch (~25× solvency margin vs block rewards). Mainnet calibration preserved as `mainnet_calibration()` constructor for the eventual mainnet genesis.
- **Singh Pool persistence: bincode file at `<data_dir>/singh_pools.bin`.** JSON was attempted (commit `51260a3`) but `serde_json` rejects `HashMap<HolderId, LpShare>` because `HolderId` is `[u8; 32]` and JSON doesn't support array-keyed maps. Caught by the test in `6fa1d61`. RocksDB-backed alternative noted as Stage 4 (Week 1 next session).
- **0x-prefix audit: complete** (6 endpoints fixed across 3 commits). All path-param hex endpoints now consistently accept both `0x`-prefixed and bare hex.
- **`light_cone_block_count` is NOT block height.** Operationally non-monotonic (sliding-window-pruned DAG count). Documented; canonical block height read is `/api/blocks?limit=1`.
- **R3 (dead-producer credit redirect) is doctrine-correct at 0.** R4's jail-on-tombstone preempts R3 in normal flow; R3 is defense-in-depth that fires only on the rare race where proposer-and-tombstoned-validator are the same in the same block.

**What's next (1-month plan from this session's wrap-up):**

Week 1 (mainnet correctness foundations):
- §1.2 conservation doctrine call (fixed-supply emission OR retract — architectural decision)
- Singh Pool Stage 4 (RocksDB persistence + state-root commitment)
- Deploy the 18 follow-up commits to the live cluster (stop-the-world per `cluster-deploy.md`)

Week 2 (observability + DAG):
- Per-tx demurrage receipt full version (Agent 4 Candidate 1 — TxOutcome → receipt store)
- ConcurrentFinality event emission (Agent 4 Candidate 3)

Week 3 (real-world data + flag-flip experiments):
- Real oracle TWAP feeds for `/api/swap`
- HBCT real Elexon BMRS integration
- Governance flag-flip experiments on isolated testnet (`conservation_enforcement: enforce`, `lambda_fold_mode: nova`, `cartel_alarm_mode: alarm`)

Week 4 (mainnet genesis prep + audit engagement):
- Tokenomics ceremony Q&A finalization (§2.1 / §2.2 / §2.5)
- External audit engagement
- Mainnet genesis ceremony rehearsal
- Cluster-health web UI dashboard

**Blockers / open questions:**

- **§1.2 conservation doctrine call** — needs human judgment on direction (fixed-supply emission vs. retract §1.2 wording). Code work depends on this.
- **18 commits accumulated awaiting deploy** — sister or future session needs to roll them via stop-the-world.

**Cross-references:**

- `CHANGELOG.md` 2026-05-08 (afternoon) — full commit-by-commit detail
- `AUDIT_2026_05_08_DECAY_LOOP.md` — pre-bundle audit + empirical correction addendum
- `docs/runbooks/cluster-deploy.md` — stop-the-world deploy procedure
- `scripts/test-singh-pool.sh` — Singh Pool live-cluster smoke test

## 2026-05-08 (morning) — Refactor A + Refactor B + cross-backend interop

**Focus:** unblock the WASM Light Client SDK build by extracting `evaporchain-consensus-types` (no RocksDB) and feature-flagging the BLS backend (pure-Rust `bls12_381` for wasm32 vs. native `blst`).

**Commits shipped:** 9. Full detail in `CHANGELOG.md` 2026-05-08 (morning).

**Deliverables:**

- `evaporchain-consensus-types` extracted (Phases 1, 2+4+5, 3a, 3b)
- BLS backend feature-flagged (`bls-native` / `bls-portable`)
- 10 cross-backend interop tests (single-sig + DST + 3-signer aggregate-verify)
- WASM build unblocked: 310 KB `.wasm` + 26 KB ES module + TS declarations

**Cross-references:**

- `CHANGELOG.md` 2026-05-08 (morning)
- `crates/evaporchain-light-client-wasm/README.md`
